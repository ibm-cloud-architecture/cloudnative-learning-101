== Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about how to build a cloud native app, its design methodology and what requirements must be included in your app during development.

== Prerequisites

- https://www.java.com/en/[Java]

== Clone the sample app

In order to view the code for this project, you will need to clone it from github.

[source, bash]
----
# Clone the sample app
git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudnative_sample_app.git

# Go to the project's root folder
cd cloudnative_sample_app/
----

== Twelve Factor Design for sample app

[big maroon]*Codebase*

Our sample application code is tracked on https://github.ibm.com/CASE/cloudnative_sample_app[Github].

[big maroon]*Dependencies*

To manage the dependencies, we use Maven as our dependency management tool. `pom.xml` will be the manifest and this fetches the dependencies as jar from different Maven repositories.

[big maroon]*Config*

To store the config, we use `.properties` file. You can find it https://github.ibm.com/CASE/cloudnative_sample_app/blob/master/src/main/resources/application.properties[here].

[big maroon]*Backing services*

This sample application is a super simple app and there are no backing services attached to it. If your application have any backing services involved, make sure they are loosely coupled and changing any of them will not alter your code.

[big maroon]*Build, release, run*

Build - Involves building your app. In our case, it will be a `JAR file`. This stage takes care of all the unit test execution. This will be part of Continuous Integration.

Release - Here the build will be taking in the environment specific configs. A unique release id will be assigned for every change.

Run - The application will be executed on the target environment. This will be part of Continuous Deployment.

[big maroon]*Processes*

Make sure your application is stateless and all the data should be persisted in the backing store.

[big maroon]*Port Binding*

Our sample app is running on an embedded Tomcat server and it is bound to the default port `8080`. You can also expose it on a different port if you want to.

[big maroon]*Concurrency*

Horizantal scaling is quite important for a cloud native application and we will use `kubernetes` to do this. You will see in the further modules how this sample app can be scaled out.

[big maroon]*Disposability*

Make sure that the application is started and stopped gracefully. In real world applications, you will have many services attached to the app. So, it should be able to handle any crash time.

[big maroon]*Dev/Prod parity*

Both the development and production environments should be as close as possible. Containerization helps the developer to simulate the production environment and we will see in the further modules how this sample app can be containerized. This also brings in Devops which also we will see in the further modules.

[big maroon]*Logs*

In our sample app, we used `SLF4J` as our logger.

[big maroon]*Admin processes*

Make sure all the process that are admin are part of deploys. This should allow you to run the maintenance tasks.

== Sample application Overview

[big maroon]*Project Structure*

The project structure of our application looks like below. We are using Maven as our build tool. Let us now take a look at the contents of our project folder.

image::project_structure.png[]

The main project folder is the src directory, which contains the Java source files. If you wanted to generate an empty project and develop it from scartch, you can use https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializer]. Let's focus on those files/folders for now.

[big maroon]*pom.xml*

As mentioned earlier, the inventory service is built using Maven, which is a build automation tool that can be used to manage application dependencies, compile the application, and even run automated tests.

Maven needs a `pom.xml` file where you can define the application dependencies and the automation tasks. Let's look at what the project's pom.xml file:

[source, xml]

</project>
----

When you look at the `pom.xml` file above, you see a few Spring Boot dependencies declared. Spring Boot was created to make the process of writing Spring applications (particularly REST applications) easier. Here is a breakdown of some of the Spring Boot dependencies:

- The `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency configures the dependencies that are needed for a web application.
- The `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency helps you monitor and manage your application.
- The `spring-boot-starter-test` dependency configures the dependencies that are needed for testing applications with libraries including JUnit, Hamcrest and Mockito.

We also use some other non-spring dependencies like `springfox-swagger2`, and `springfox-swagger-ui`.

Let us now look at the `src` folder of our project.

[big maroon]*Source Code*

In this section we will go over the contents of the `src` folder.

*SBApplication.java*

*SBApplication.java* is the project's main class. To see its contents, run `cat src/main/java/application/SBApplication.java` and you should see something like the following:

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
public class SBApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SBApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----

The class is annotated with `@SpringBootApplication` which indicates that the application is built in Spring Boot. This annotation is equivalent to the following annotations with their default attributes:

- `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Enables Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration mechanism
- `@ComponentScan`: Enables @Component scan on the package where the application is located (see the best practices)
- `@Configuration`: Allows to register extra beans in the context or import additional configuration classes

*Entity Class*

`Greeting.java` is the project's Entity class. To see its contents, run `cat src/main/java/application/model/Greeting.java` and you should see the following file:

[source, java]
----
package application.model;

public class Greeting {

	private final long id;

    private final String content;

    public Greeting(long id, String content) {
        this.id = id;
        this.content = content;
    }

    public long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public String getContent() {
        return content;
    }
}
----

[big maroon]*Creating REST Endpoints*

We have a REST endpoint defined in our application. For that we will need a `Spring RestController`.

`GreetingController.java` is the project's RestController class. To see its contents, run `cat src/main/java/application/rest/GreetingController.java` and you should see the following file:

[source, java]
----
package application.rest;

import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import application.model.Greeting;
import io.swagger.annotations.Api;

@Api(tags = { "Greeting API" })
@RestController
public class GreetingController {

	Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GreetingController.class);

	@Value("${greetings}")
	private String welcomeMsg;

	private static final String template = "Hello, %s :)";
    private final AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong();

    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public Greeting greeting(@RequestParam(value="name", defaultValue="User") String name) {
        logger.info("Greeting api counter info "+counter.incrementAndGet());
        return new Greeting(counter.incrementAndGet(),
        		welcomeMsg+" "+String.format(template, name));
    }

}
----

Let us stop by here a minute and see what our RestController does. This class is pretty simple to understand. It has one method that exposes the endpoint `/greeting` for HTTP GET request.

The **greeting(@RequestParam(value="name", defaultValue="User") String name)** method is annotated with `@GetMapping("/greeting")` and this method returns a welcome message.

== Externalizing Config

For this application, the configurations are all stored in the `application.properties` file. This file will pick up the environment variables. To see its contents, run `cat src/main/resources/application.properties` and you should see the following file:

[source, properties]
----
greetings=Welcome to Cloudnative bootcamp !!!

# info endpoint
info.app.name=Greetings application
info.app.description=Demo application for bootcamp
info.app.version=1.0.0

# Enabling all management endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*

----

If you observe the GreetingController class, we are passing the environmental variable `greetings=Welcome to Cloudnative bootcamp !!!` from `application.properties` as follows in `GreetingController.java`.

[source, java]
----
@Value("${greetings}")
private String welcomeMsg;
----

== Health check

Spring boot actuator brings us feature which allows us to monitor the health of our application. You can access it at `/actuator/health` endpoint. This endpoint is not sensitive by default and you don't need any admin permissions for that.

== Metrics

Spring boot actuator brings us feature which allows us to gather metrics for your application. You can access it at `/actuator/metrics` endpoint. This endpoint is sensitive and you need admin permissions for that.

== Tracing

Spring boot actuator brings us feature which displays trace information. You can access it at `/actuator/httptrace` endpoint. This endpoint is sensitive and you need admin permissions for that.

== Logging

For logging, we are using slf4j for logging. You can enable it as follows.

[source, java]
----
Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(GreetingController.class);
----

== API documentation

API documentation is important in today's world of microservices. In our sample app, we used *Swagger* for API documentation.

To enable this, add `springfox-swagger2` and `springfox-swagger-ui` as dependency.

To see the Swagger config, run `cat src/main/java/application/SwaggerConfig.java`. You see the file as below.

[source, java]
----
package application;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

import springfox.documentation.builders.ApiInfoBuilder;
import springfox.documentation.builders.PathSelectors;
import springfox.documentation.builders.RequestHandlerSelectors;
import springfox.documentation.service.ApiInfo;
import springfox.documentation.service.Tag;
import springfox.documentation.spi.DocumentationType;
import springfox.documentation.spring.web.plugins.Docket;
import springfox.documentation.swagger2.annotations.EnableSwagger2;

@Configuration
@EnableSwagger2
public class SwaggerConfig {

	@Bean
    public Docket productApi() {
        return new Docket(DocumentationType.SWAGGER_2)
                .select()
                .apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.basePackage("application"))
                //.apis(RequestHandlerSelectors.any())
                .paths(PathSelectors.any())
                .build()
                .apiInfo(apiInfo()).tags(new Tag("Greeting API", "Welcome message"));
    }

	private ApiInfo apiInfo() {
		return new ApiInfoBuilder().title("Greetings Microservice").version("1.0.0").build();
	}

}
