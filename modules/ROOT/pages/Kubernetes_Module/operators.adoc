== Helm
Helm is a package manager built atop of Kubernetes.  Helm is used to steamline installation and management of Kubernetes applications.  Helm is good for sharing built applications across teams, managing kubernetes manifest files, and maintaining consistent builds through each release.  Helm use a tool called a Helm Chart to package together pre-configured Kubernetes resources for a given application.  Helm Charts contain at least two things, a description of the package (Chart.yaml) and the necessary kubernetes manifest files.

=== Helm Charts

Helm Charts are a collection of files for Kubernetes to create resources with.  Charts can be used to deploy a simple service with one function or something very complex such as a full stack web application with backend services.  Helm Charts are a collection of files inside of a directory containing the `Chart.yaml` file which is required for each helm chart that is created.

.Example Chart.yaml
----
name: nginx
description: A basic NGINX HTTP server
version: 0.1.0
kubeVersion: ">=1.2.0"
keywords:
  - http
  - nginx
  - www
  - web
home: https://github.com/helm/helm
sources:
  - https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/
maintainers:
  - name: technosophos
    email: mbutcher@deis.com
----

Each `Chart.yaml` file declares the name of the chart with a description, version, and kubernetes version it is running.  Every chart must have a version number that follows the https://semver.org/[SemVer 2, window="_blank"] standard.

==== Declaring Helm Chart Dependencies
Helm charts may depend on any number of other charts and these charts can be linked through the `requirements.yaml` file. The `requirements.yaml` file simply lists the name, version, and repository for each of the charts that are required.

.Example Requirements.yaml
----
dependencies:
  - name: apache
    version: 1.2.3
    repository: http://example.com/charts
  - name: mysql
    version: 3.2.1
    repository: http://another.example.com/charts
----

Once dependencies are declared, you can run `helm dependency update` to download all the charts listed in the requirements file and have them stored in the `charts/` directory for use by the `Chart.yaml`.

== Operators

Operators in Kubernetes is a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application.  To take full advantage of Kubernetes features, applications need to have an set of API's to help service and manage applications and operators act as a runtime for these types of applications.  Operators are built using the Operator SDK and need kubernetes in order to be deployed.  There is an Operator Framework which includes three main parts: Operator SDK, Operator Lifecycle Manager, and Operator Monitoring.  Check out the link below to learn more about each.

=== IBM Cloud Operator

The IBM Cloud Operator provides a Kubernetes CRD-Based API that gives users the ability to provision and manage bindings of IBM public cloud services.  The operator can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster version 1.11 or higher.  The operator means there is no longer a need for out-of-band processes in order to use cloud services within the users applications being hosted on the cluster.  In order to run the IBM Cloud Operator on a cluster the administrator needs the following things:

- IBM Cloud Account
- IBM Cloud CLI
- Kubectl CLI

The operator is installed and removed through two different scripts provided in the operators documentation.

=== MongoDB Operator

The MongoDB Enterprise Operator gives users the ability to easily deploy MongoDB into Kubernetes clusters. THe operator allows users to manage, monitor, and perform backups on the different instances of MongoDB within the cluster.  The operator can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster version 1.11 or higher and has been tested on OpenShift version 3.11.  The MongoDB operator requires https://docs.opsmanager.mongodb.com/current/[Ops Manager , window="_blank"] and Cloud Manager.

To install the operator a namespace named "mongodb" must be created first, then the operator can installed one of two ways.

.Namespace Creation

[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl create namespace mongodb
----
