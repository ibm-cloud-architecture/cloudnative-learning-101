== Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about how to deploy applications to Kubernetes using Helm. We will be using pre-created helm charts for the deployment.

== Prerequisites

- You will need an IBM Account for https://cloud.ibm.com/[IBM Cloud]
- Downloaded and installed the IBM Cloud CLI at https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#step1-install-idt[IBM Cloud CLI Installation]. Follow the instructions for your computer's operating system.
- Downloaded and installed the Helm CLI at https://github.com/helm/helm#install[Helm CLI Installation].
- Downloaded and installed the Kubernetes CLI at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[Kubernetes CLI Installation]. Follow the instructions for your computer's operating system.

== IBM Cloud Login

Start by opening a web browser and navigating to https://cloud.ibm.com/[IBM Cloud].

Next *_login_* with your IBM Cloud login you created.  After login you will be navigated to your *Cloud Dashboard*.

On the *Cloud Dashboard* in the resource summary section, select *Kubernetes Clusters*.

In Kubernetes Cluster list, select the cluster you would like to access. Make sure the cluster you select has a blue square icon next to it.  

== Accessing the Kubernetes Cluster

Once on the *Overview* screen of your Kubernetes cluster in the top right corner, select *Connect via CLI* and follow the onscreen instructions.

Once logged in with the *CLI* we need to get the sample application.

== Getting the Sample Application

Download the sample application from Github: https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudnative_sample_app[Sample App]

== Deploying the Sample Application using Helm

In this section we will deploy the sample application that you downloaded using the Helm CLI in your terminal or cmd prompt.
The helm charts are already pre-created in the `/chart` directory of the application directory.  

=== Checking the Namespace
To check the namespace you are deploying your application to run the following command:

.View Namespace
[source, bash]
----
oc projects
----

Always double check the namespace your Kubernetes is set for to make sure you are deploying the application where you would like it to be in your Kubernetes Cluster.

=== Application Deployment

To deploy the Application we first want to ensure that we have helm template charts created. In this sample app we won't have to create any templates, but we are going to modify the deployment.yaml using templates. Let's start by doing that.

In the `chart/cloudnativesampleapp` directory in your sample application run:

.Changing Replica Count
[source, bash]
----
helm template . --set replicaCount=2 > deployment.yaml
----

That will set the replicaCount in the deployment file to 2. Next we need to deploy the new change by running the following:

.Deploy Deployment
[source, bash]
----
oc apply -f deployment.yaml
----

And that's it. You have now deployed using a Helm Template.

To verify your deployment just run:

.Verify Deployment
[source, bash]
---- 
oc get deployment
----

=== Accessing the Application

To access the application we need to expose the service.  To do that we will run the following:

.Expose Service
[source, bash]
---- 
oc expose service cloudnativesampleapp-service
----

Next, we need to find the route that was exposed for the application. We find that by running:

.Service Route
[source, bash]
----
oc get route
----

Next copy the `PATH` it will look similar to `greeting-service-deploy-sample.gse-cloud-native-fa9ee67c9ab6a7791435450358e564cc-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud`.
Finally we want to run a `curl` against the copied path with `/greeting` appended on the end to see the response.

.Curl
[source, bash]
----
curl PATH/greeting
----

You should get a response similar to: `Welcome to Cloudnative bootcamp !!!`

== Conclusion

You have successfully completed this lab! Let's take a look at what you learned and did today:

    - Modified a Helm Chart value.
    - Deployed an application using a Helm Chart. 
    - Exposed the application to the internet.
    - Accessed the deployed application via a CURL command.
