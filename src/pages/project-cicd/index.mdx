## Challenge

You are provided with the challenge to implement a demo that shows best practices for DevOps.
Implement Continous Integration and Continous Deployment for an Application on Kubernetes.

You are being provided with:
- OpenShift 4
- Git repository containing application source code
- Git repository containing deployment manifests (ie. yamls)

## Specifications

### Access Cluster
- Ask your instructors on how to gain access to OpenShift cluster
- Create a new namespace to deploy the application `project-cicd-${userid}`

### Code Repo
- Git repository for Code is located https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudnative_sample_app
- Create a new Git repository on your own public git account using the git repo as a template
- Use the `Dockerfile` on the root of the repository to build an container image

### Infra Repo
- Git repository for Manifets (ie Yamls) is located https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudnative_sample_app_deploy
- Create a new Git repository on your own public git account using the git repo as a template
- The directory `yamls` on the repository contains the deployment manifests to deploy the app

### Argocd
- Argocd is already installed on the OpenShift cluster using an operator on the namespace `argocd`
- To login into the Argocd use username `admin` and password the name of the argocd pod
- Ge the ArgoCD UI URL with the following command
    ```bash
    export ARGOCD_URL="https://$(oc get route argocd-server -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
    echo "ARGOCD URL=$ARGOCD_URL"
    open "$ARGOCD_URL"
    ```
- Deploy the application on the new namespace using infra git repositoryurl and configure with autosync when every time there is a change in the Infra repo.

### Tekton
- Tekton is already installed on the OpenShift cluster using an operator
- The service account to use to run the pipelines is `pipeline` it automatically gets created on every new namespace
- Use the following guide to create a Pipeline, Tasks, and secret:
    ![Tekton Pipeline](images/tekton-pipeline.png)
    - Create a pipeline, tasks, secrets on the target namespace
    - Git clone the source code from the App repo
    - Build a container image using the `Dockerfile` on the repo
    - Tag the image using the 7 first characters of the git hash corresponding to last git commit
    - Push the container image into the internal image registry on the same namespace
    - Git clone the Infra git repo
    - Update the image on the deployment yaml with the new image id that has the tag with value of the git commit
    - Git commit the changes
    - Git push the changes to the infra git repo, this should trigger argocd to pickup any changes from the infra repo.

## Hints

- Use [task-git-push.yaml](/yamls/project-cicd/task-git-push.yaml) as an example of Tekton steps to git clone, edit yaml files, and git push
- Use [git-infra-secret.yaml](/yamls/project-cicd/git-infra-secret.yaml) as an example of Kubernetes secret being reference by the `git-push` task
- The secret contains the git username and token with permission `repo` that gives write access to repository
- OpenShift 4 comes with an internal image registry you can push from a Tekton task
- The image registry url contains the service name, port, namespace, image name and tag
    ```
    image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/my-namespace-app/image-name:my-tag
    ```
- The image registry only handles ssl/https connections, but it uses a self sign certificate
- You need to ignore TLS-Verify to be able to succesfully push and ignore ssl errors for example using buildah set the flag `--tls-verify="false"`


## Extra Credit

- Make the pipeline to run automatically every time new code gets pushed to the Code git repository
  - Configure a Github Webhook using the new [Tekton Triggers](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers) listener and bindings
  - You can use the Tekton Getting Started as guide on how to implement the Webhook
  - [Install](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/blob/master/docs/install.md) Triggers, check out the
    [installation guide](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/blob/master/docs/install.md), [examples](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/blob/master/examples/README.md) or
    follow the [getting started guide](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/blob/master/docs/getting-started/README.md) to become
    familiar with the project. The getting started guide walks through setting up an
    end-to-end image building solution, which will be triggered from GitHub `push`
    events.
