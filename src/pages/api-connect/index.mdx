## API Connect

API Connect is a way to quickly create API's and microservices using Node.js and Java runtimes. API Connect allows you to easily create, run, manage and secure API's in one offering.

## Components

**Cloud Manager**

The Cloud Manager is used for on-premise API Connect instances.  The Cloud Administrator will use the Cloud Manager UI for the following:

* Define the Cluster of Management Servers, Gateways, and Containers.
* Manage the topology of the servers and containers.
* Manage the servers in the cloud.
* Monitor Cloud Health.
* Manager User Access Controls.
* Adding user registries for authenticating users and securing APIs, and configure the secure transmission of data.

**The Developer Toolkit**

The developer toolkit provides the tools for modeling, developing, and testing APIs and LoopBackÂ® applications. The developer toolkit includes a command line interface (CLI) and a corresponding graphical user interface, the API Designer. It incorporates LoopBack, an open source Node.js framework.

**API Manager**

The API Manager provides a user interface that facilitates promotion and tracking of APIs that are packaged within Products and Plans. API providers can move the Products through their lifecycle, and manage the availability and visibility of APIs and Plans.

**API Gateways**

## Use Cases

#### Data 

Securing data and relies deeply on apis.

#### Mobile 

Mobile apps use apis to interact with backend systems.

#### Social

Access to social media 

#### Internal Scenarios

Internal auditing, compliance can benefit using API connect.
