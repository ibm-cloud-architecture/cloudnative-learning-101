title: Event-Driven Architecture Lab Solution 1 - Getting Started with Producing & Consuming
description: Lab activities associated with producing and consuming messages from an IBM Event Streams on Cloud instance, to be used with event-driven architecture enablement.
---

## Solution - NodeJS

Utilize https://github.com/ibm-messaging/event-streams-samples/tree/master/kafka-nodejs-console-sample/docs as needed for pointers.

1. `git clone https://github.com/ibm-messaging/event-streams-samples.git`
2. `cd event-streams-samples/kafka-nodejs-console-sample`
3. Acquire the `Bootstrap server` information from the **Connect to this service** dialog on the **Manage** tab of the your IBM Event Streams on Cloud instance and save it to an environment variable named BOOTSTRAP_NODES.
4. Acquire the `API Key` from the **Service Credentials** tab of your IBM Event Streams on Cloud instance and save it to an environment variable named API_KEY.
5. `docker build -t eventstreams-samples-nodejs .`
6. `docker run --rm -it eventstreams-samples-nodejs:latest  "${BOOTSTRAP_NODES}" "${API_KEY}" "/etc/ssl/certs"`

## Solution - Java

Utilize https://github.com/ibm-messaging/event-streams-samples/tree/master/kafka-java-console-sample/docs as needed for pointers.

1. `git clone https://github.com/ibm-messaging/event-streams-samples.git`
2. `cd event-streams-samples/kafka-java-console-sample`
3. Acquire the `Bootstrap server` information from the **Connect to this service** dialog on the **Manage** tab of the your IBM Event Streams on Cloud instance and save it to an environment variable named BOOTSTRAP_NODES.
4. Acquire the `API Key` from the **Service Credentials** tab of your IBM Event Streams on Cloud instance and save it to an environment variable named API_KEY.
5. `docker build -t eventstreams-samples-java .`
6. `docker run --rm -it eventstreams-samples-java:latest  "${BOOTSTRAP_NODES}" "${API_KEY}"`
