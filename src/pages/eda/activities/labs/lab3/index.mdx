## Problem

Use cutting-edge technologies to reduce the overall footprint _(including build time, dependent projects, management overhead, and more!)_ of microservice deployments in cloud-native application development.

### Using Reactive Messaging on OpenLiberty

Learn how to build reactive microservices that can asynchronously communicate with other event-driven microservices. Using an external Kafka instance _(in the case of the bootcamp, an IBM Event Streams on Cloud instance)_, you will create microservices which communicate amongst themselves as a stream of events by using the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging implementation to easily bind configuration information, as well as send, receive, and process all relevant business logic.

Follow along with the tutorial at https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-reactive-messaging.html to get started with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging on OpenLiberty.

### Using Reactive Messaging with Quarkus

Quarkus is advertised as a [_"supersonic subatomic Java"_](https://quarkus.io/) option to build Kubernetes-native Java microservices, which utilize the GraalVM for fast boot time, incredibly low memory footprints, and many other dimensions which make it perfect for building cloud-scale applications.

Follow along with the tutorial at https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka to get started with MicroProfile Reactive Messaging on Quarkys.

## Verification

Verification steps are provided in each of the respective tutorials.

## Extra credit

Using your knowledge of containerization and CI/CD pipelines gained through the bootcamp, construct a pipeline that will build, deploy, and manage these sample applications on a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud.
