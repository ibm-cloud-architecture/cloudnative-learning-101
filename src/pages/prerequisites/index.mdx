## Required skills

This activites contained here require you to be proficient in working from the command line with a linux shell (Bash, Zsh, etc.) Below is a partial list of activites you should be able to perform. 

- Copy, move, and rename files
- Understand linux file permissions
- Edit text files (vi, vim, emacs, etc)
- Edit environment variables ($PATH)

Here is a course for learning (or brushing up) on working from the linux command line [Linux Command Line Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595)

## Create accounts

You'll need these accounts to use the Developer Tools environment.

- [GitHub account](http://github.com) (public, not enterprise): Create one if you do not have one aleady. If you have not logged in for a while, make sure your login is working.

- [IBM Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com): Create one if needed, make sure you can log in. 

- [Katacoda Account](https://www.katacoda.com/): The account is free and easy to create.

- [RedHat Account](https://www.redhat.com/en): Needed for CodeReady Containers.

## Run System Check Script

Run the following command in your terminal to check which tools need to be installed.

Using `wget`:

```
wget -O - https://cloudnative101.dev/scripts/setup/system-check.sh | sh
```

Using `curl`:

```
curl -s https://cloudnative101.dev/scripts/setup/system-check.sh | sh
```

After the script is run, make sure to install any missing tools.

## Install CLIs and tools

The following is a list of desktop tools required to help with installation and development.

- [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/): Needs to be installed in your development operating system, it comes as standard for Mac OS

- [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started): Required for management of IBM Cloud Account and management of your managed IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift clusters
    - Don't install just the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli), install the [IBM Cloud CLI and Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#step1-install-idt)
    ```
    curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```

## Environment Setup 
<Tabs>

<Tab label="MiniKube">

- Verify your cluster has 4GB+ memory, and kubernetes 1.16+
    ```
    minikube config view
    ```
- Verify your `vm-driver` is set for `hyperkit`
    ```
    minikube config set vm-driver hyperkit
    ```
- In case memory is not set, or need to increase set the memory and recreate the VM
    ```
    minikube config set memory 4096
    minikube config set kubernetes-version v1.16.6
    minikube delete
    minikube start
    ```
- Kubernetes should be v1.15+
    ```
    kubectl version
    ```

</Tab>

<Tab label="CRC (MiniShift)">

Make sure CRC is installed. Check out the [CRC Page](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.0/html/getting_started_guide/getting-started-with-codeready-containers_gsg) 

** Setup CRC **
```
  crc setup
```
** Start CRC **
```
  crc start
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="IKS">

- Login to [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com) with your IBM ID.

- Click "Create Resource" and search for "kubernetes service".

- Select the tile for "Kubernetes Service" and do the following:
  - Select the "Free Cluster" plan.
  - Name your cluster.
  - Select "Create" at the bottom right of the screen.

- Once the Cluster is provisioned, Click on the "Connect via CLI" in the top right corner.

- Follow the instructions to connect and you are set to go.

</Tab>

<Tab label="OpenShift on IBM Cloud (4.x)">

- In this approach you share an OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud with other bootcamp attendees.

- Considering 10-15 attendees we recommend a cluster with 3 worker nodes (each 8 vCPUs + 32GB RAM - b3c.8x32).

- Ask your IBM cloud account owner to provide access to an OpenShift cluster.

- In addition to the IBM Cloud CLI also install the [OpenShift Origin CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift-cli#cli_oc) to be able to execute all commands.

- Open your OpenShift web console from within your IBM cloud account, select your profile and choose "copy login command" to retrieve an access token for the login.

- Login with your OpenShift Origin CLI.
    ```
      oc login --token=<token> --server=<server-url>:<server-port>
    ```

- Create your own project / namespace in OpenShift that you will leverage across all labs.
    ```
      oc new-project <dev-your_initials>
    ```

- Validate in the OpenShift web console that your project has been created (Administrator view -> Home -> Projects)
