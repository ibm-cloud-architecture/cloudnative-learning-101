## Problem

The Hyper Drive isn't working and we need to find out why. Let's debug the `hyper-drive` deployment so that we can reach light speed again.

Here are some tips to help you solve the Hyper Drive:

- Check the description of the `deployment`.
- Get the logs of one of the broken `pods`.
- Are the correct `ports` assigned.
- Make sure your `labels` and `selectors` are correct.
- Check to see if the `Probes` are correctly working.

Reset the environment:
```
minikube delete
minikube start
```

Setup the environment:
```
kubectl apply -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/csantanapr/87df4292e94441617707dae5de488cf4/raw/cb515f7bae77a3f0e76fdc7f6aa0f4e89cc5fec7/lab-5-debug-k8s-setup.yaml
```

## Validate

Once you get the Hyper Drive working again. Verify it by checking the endpoints.

```
kubectl get ep hyper-drive
```
